  <p>I use to be a manager at a cafe, very normal job, there were two customers who were deaf and I insisted on myself to
  learn sign language, even the smallest bit of phrases for a coffee house. They were so surprised the day I started and
  started signing a bunch of stuff, I could hardly keep up with their dancing arms signing another amazing story. So then I
  had to learn more. I think I really changed something in them, and in myself, communication is one of the most important
  parts of being human and some people don't have a choice in the matter. I hope this, even briefly, can help you learn, maybe
  a new dance, maybe to brighten someones day, or even how to say something you been meaning to say. Take care.</p>
