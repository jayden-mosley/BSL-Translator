  <h1>BSL Sentence Structure</h1>
  <p>BSL has a different sentence structure to both English. As the most basic linguistic analysis, BSL is described as 
    having a topic-comment sign order. Throw the ball being signed – Ball, throw. Using commonly applied linguistic 
    terminology to identify sentence structure, English and BSL have the following sentence structure:
    <p>• English: Subject – Verb – Object 
    (The boy rides a bike)</p>
    <p>• BSL: Object – Subject – Verb 
    (bike the boy rides)</p>

  <h2>Smile!</h2>
  <p>Facial expressions are just one aspect of what are called non-manual features (NMF) within BSL. NMF can make up as much 
    as 50% of the meaning of BSL, so it is important for children to learn facial expressions and the manual sign at the same time.</p>

  <h2>Dominant Hand</h2>
  <p>When using BSL, left-handed and right-handed people use different hands, but this must be consistent. Whilst BSL uses a 
    2-handed signing system, the dominant hand does most of the movement.</p>

  <h2>True Meaning</h2>
  <p>In English and Welsh, some words have multiple meanings. When translating from any language into BSL, it is the true meaning 
    that must be signed.</p>

  <p>Please keep this important design in mind if you are trying to practise phrases or learning BSL as this will
  help maximise your communication experience with others.</p>
