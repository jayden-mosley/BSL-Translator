  <h1>BSL Sentence Structure</h1>
  <p>BSL has a different sentence structure to both English. As the most basic linguistic analysis, BSL is described as 
    having a topic-comment sign order. Throw the ball being signed – Ball, throw. Using commonly applied linguistic 
    terminology to identify sentence structure, English and BSL have the following sentence structure:
    • English: Subject – Verb – Object 
    (The boy rides a bike)
    • BSL: Object – Subject – Verb 
    (bike the boy rides)</p>
  <p>Please keep this important design in mind if you are trying to practise phrases or learning BSL as this will
  help maximise your communication experience with others.</p>
